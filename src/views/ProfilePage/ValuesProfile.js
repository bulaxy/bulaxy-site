				"The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete."
				Mark Zuckerberg

			<p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
				I have no experience in hacking or being a hacker, but as a developer, I completely agree that something can always be better.
				Everyone have difference background, experiences and stories. Everyone started differently,
				but what all of us can do right here, right now is - LEARNING & SELF-IMPROVING. Learning about yourself, learning new skills
				learning about things around you. Only through learnning, you can improve, only through learning, you can evolve.
			</p>
			<p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
				I am sure I am not the most experienced and smart developer around me, but I am learning. 
				Learning not only benefit myself, after I learnt these skills, it allow me to teach friends
				or help my friends build some bots/programs! Some frieneds wanted to learn how to write a discord bot? Learn Discordjs myself then teach them!
				My friends keep wanting to check some information from some pages perioditctly, build a command/features on a bot to help them do so!
